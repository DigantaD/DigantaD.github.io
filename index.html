	        	<h3 id="Salah">Mohamed Salah wins PFA Player of the Year 2018</h3>
	        	<p> Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah has been named as the Professional Footballers’ Association player of the year for the 2017-18 season.<br>The Egypt international saw off competition from the Manchester City trio of Kevin De Bruyne, Leroy Sané and David Silva to become the second African player to win the award after Riyad Mahrez of Leicester in 2016. Tottenham’s Harry Kane came third, with De Bruyne second. Salah, who moved to Anfield from Roma last June for a club record fee of £36.9m, has scored 43 goals(*) in his debut season as Jürgen Klopp’s side have reached the semi-finals of the Champions League.<br>Salah was presented with the award at the Grosvenor Hotel in London on Sunday evening, with City’s winger Sané voted as young player of the year.<br>“It’s an honour to win this award especially because it was voted for by the other players,” said Salah. “I would like to thank my team-mates and everyone at the club for helping me to make this happen.”<br>Asked what it meant to become the first Egyptian to win the award, he said: “Hopefully I’m not the last one. I’m very proud to win and I’ve worked very hard.”<br>While not unexpected given his stunning debut season at Anfield, Salah faced strong competition from the Belgium international De Bruyne, who has been the standout player for the champions.<br></p>

	        	<h3 id="Mavi">India U-19 star Shivam Mavi continues his express pace in VIVO IPL 2018 for KKR</h3>
	        	<p> Former Australian pacer Brett Lee has heaped praise on Kolkata Knight Riders' (KKR) pacer Shivam Mavi, underlining the young talent as the `Future of Indian Bowling`.<br>Talking about Mavi's technique and confidence on the field, Brett Lee said, "I think Mavi has got everything. His actions are beautiful and he packs himself as a fully furnished bowler. With youngsters like Mavi, it's extremely important to play with confidence, enjoying the spirit of the game. He knows what he's doing and it looks like he really enjoys his cricket. I think Mavi for me is the future for Indian bowlers."<br>Shivam Mavi, KKR's new pace battery for the ongoing 11th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), caught everyone's attention during the ICC U-19 World Cup earlier this year where he bowled at a jarring pace.<br>The young pacer clocked more than 140 kmph regularly and soon became the spectacle of the tournament owing to his bowling abilities.<br>Revered and recognized for his lethal bouncer and a constant drive to improve himself and become faster, Mavi is certainly one of the most notable young upcoming fast bowlers in the country.<br>Following his spectacular performance in the ICC U-19 World Cup, KKR picked him up in the IPL Players auction in February.<br>The winning pacer grabbed the eyeballs of cricket fans when he dismissed former Delhi Daredevils skipper Gautam Gambhir, during his 'homecoming' match against Kolkata Knight Riders. Gambhir was dismissed by Mavi in seven balls during the pacers second IPL outing.</p>
